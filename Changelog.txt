# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [V4] 2023-04-21

### Notes

### Added
- Data Dictionary tab
- CTD data from CCGS Franklin and R/V Shimada from 2022
- Trawl and specimen data from 2019 and 2020
- Taxonomic abundance Bongo zooplankton data from 2019, 2020 and 2022. 
- Columns for visceral adhesion and marks/scars
- Original unique IDs for events (original_event_id), taxa observed (original_catch_id) and specimen measured (original_specimen_id), as recorded by the data provider. Please note, that data providers could have used similar naming systems on their vessels, and as a result the original_specimen_ids might NOT be unique within this workbook. Ensure that the specimen_ids are associated with the correct vessel.

### Changed
- "alternative_event_id", "alternative_catch_id", and "alternative_specimen_id" columns have been renamed to "original_event_id", "original_catch_id", and "original_specimen_id" respectively.

### Removed
- Removed columns 'gonad_weight_grams' and 'stomach_fullness' as we only had these for a single vessel. 
- Removed empty columns (i.e. 'catch_volume', 'catch_volume_units', 'weather_description' and 'swell_height_meters').
  

## [V3] 2022-09-21

### Notes

### Added
- Scripts for generating maps. See maps folder for maps and scripts/map_scripts for the code used to generate maps. Note the script name and map name match
- The planned Raw Spirit vessel sampling coordinates were added to the sampling event table, despite not having received any data from the Raw Spirit yet.
- In the tab `Sampling_Events`, added a column `dataset_doi` so that data users understand which DOI to reference when using the dataset. 

### Changed
- Updated standardized data so the station names of the CTD casts match are now the same as the trawl set number that the CTD cast is associated with. Original CTD station names included numbers and letters eg. station 1, 2, P, AB. Trawls were not assigned the same stations in the bridgelog only a set number. The CTD and Rosette staion numbers don't match with the trawl set numbers, so we retained the original CTD/Rosette station name in a column called 'alternate_station_id' but changed station to match the trawl set number so that future bottle samples can be matched to either the trawl or the CTD/Rosette station. The cross walk for trawl set number and CTD/Rosette station number was found in a table called 'UBC Trawl sample data_dec2020' in this google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1etM9o4ZKfNHDdDRPeAvsMK5j6NNPqrgHGDsdbC3m3Is/edit#gid=1300978020
- Changes the 2019 Kaganovksy CTD station numbers to match Trawl station numbers. In previous versions the 2019 CTD data were used stations that were incrementing from previous work (not related to IYS) done by the Kaganovsky crew in the western Pacific. 


## [V2] - 2022-08-17

### Notes

Mostly minor updates for formatting of column names and the addition of 2019 CTD data
Tab names have been changed to `Sampling_Events`, `Trawl_Catch_Data`, `Trawl_Specimen_Data` and `CTD_Data`. 

### Added
- 2019 CTD data from the Professor Kaganovksy
- 2020 CTD data from the Pacific Legacy
- In the Sampling Events sheet: day_of_year column
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data sheet: verbatim_identification column to indicate original formulation of scientific_name per data provider.
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data sheet: Zero-catch trawl events have been added.
- Columns alternative_event_id, alternative_catch_id and alternative_specimen_id to reflect naming systems used by different organizations. These columns are populated in their respective data tabs.  
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data and Trawl_Specimen_Data sheets: scientific_name_id with the LSID to the species or taxa in WoRMS Registry. 
- In the CTD_Data sheet: columns added for event_date, latitude_start_decdeg and longitude_start_decdeg. 

### Changed
- Column headers are now all in lower_case
- time_zone_code to only show 'UTC' (instead of both UTC and GMT).
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data sheet: scientific_name now reflects correct WoRMS names. 
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data sheet: scientific_name now reflects correct WoRMS names. 
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data sheet: length_units and weight_units have been standardized to 'Millimeters' and 'Grams' respectively. 
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data sheet: `Barcode number` is now reflected in 'alternative_specimen_id` column. 
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data sheet: abbreviations in the sex column (i.e. 'm' and 'f') have been changed to 'male' and 'female' respectively. '?' has been changed to 'unknown'. 


### Removed
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data and Trawl_Specimen_Data sheets, 'sp.' has been removed from the scientific_name column.
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data, columns Fin_clip, and Gill:Note have been removed. 
- In the CTD_Data, columns sea_water_conductivity:Sampling_Depth_Meters have been removed. 

## [V1] - 2022-07-08

### Notes

This is the first version of the Integrated IYS Data collection. It only contains trawl catch and specimen data from 2022. There is a known issue with the NW explorer event IDs and we are working to resovle this. 

This version is mainly interim and will update as new data and corrections become available.

### Added
- Shimada, TINRO and NW Explorer Trawl event, Catch, and specimen data

### Changed
- NA

### Removed
- NA
