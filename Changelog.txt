## [V2] - 2022-08-17

### Notes

Mostly minor updates for formatting of column names and the addition of 2019 CTD data
Tab names have been changed to `Sampling_Events`, `Trawl_Catch_Data`, `Trawl_Specimen_Data` and `CTD_Data`. 

### Added
- 2019 CTD data from the Professor Kaganovksy
- 2020 CTD data from the Pacific Legacy
- In the Sampling Events sheet: day_of_year column
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data sheet: verbatim_identification column to indicate original formulation of scientific_name per data provider.
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data sheet: Zero-catch trawl events have been added.
- Columns alternative_event_id, alternative_catch_id and alternative_specimen_id to reflect naming systems used by different organizations. These columns are populated in their respective data tabs.  
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data and Trawl_Specimen_Data sheets: scientific_name_id with the LSID to the species or taxa in WoRMS Registry. 
- In the CTD_Data sheet: columns added for event_date, latitude_start_decdeg and longitude_start_decdeg. 

### Changed
- Column headers are now all in lower_case
- time_zone_code to only show 'UTC' (instead of both UTC and GMT).
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data sheet: scientific_name now reflects correct WoRMS names. 
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data sheet: scientific_name now reflects correct WoRMS names. 
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data sheet: length_units and weight_units have been standardized to 'Millimeters' and 'Grams' respectively. 
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data sheet: `Barcode number` is now reflected in 'alternative_specimen_id` column. 
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data sheet: abbreviations in the sex column (i.e. 'm' and 'f') have been changed to 'male' and 'female' respectively. '?' has been changed to 'unknown'. 


### Removed
- In the Trawl_Catch_Data and Trawl_Specimen_Data sheets, 'sp.' has been removed from the scientific_name column.
- In the Trawl_Specimen_Data, columns Fin_clip, and Gill:Note have been removed.

## [V1] - 2022-07-08

### Notes

This is the first version of the Integrated IYS Data collection. It only contains trawl catch and specimen data from 2022. There is a known issue with the NW explorer event IDs and we are working to resovle this. 

This version is mainly interim and will update as new data and corrections become available.

### Added
- Shimada, TINRO and NW Explorer Trawl event, Catch, and specimen data

### Changed
- NA

### Removed
- NA
