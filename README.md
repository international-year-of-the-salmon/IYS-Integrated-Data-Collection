## Hi there 👋

🙋 Welcome to the repository for the Integrated Data Collection. This dataset is a collection of all the International Year of the Salmon High Seas Expedition trawl catch, collected specimen measurements, salmon diet, CTD and chemistry datasets that were collected at sea in 2019 aboard the Professor Kaganovsky, 2020 on the Pacific Legacy NO.1, and 2022 aboard the CCGS Sir John Franklin, R/V Bell M Shimada, R/V TINRO, R/V Northwest Explorer and F/V Raw Spirit. These data span the entire North Pacific Ocean and were collected to better our understanding of the ocean conditions salmon experience during winter and how that they may drive high seas salmon survival.

🐟 The repository is structured as follows: 
  * `input_datasets` contains processed data files (not standardized) that have been sent to the IYS Data Scientists.
  * `output_datasets` contains the individual integrated datasets specific to a data type (i.e. bridgelog, trawl, specimen, CTD). These datasets are aggregated and integrated within the IYS_Integrated_Data_Collection_MASTER workbook. 
  * `archived_versions` contains older versions of the IYS_Integrated_Data_Collection_MASTER.xlsx file. Any changes between versions are recorded in the Changelog. 
  * `scripts` contains the code used to format and integrate the input datasets into the individual output datasets and the master file.
