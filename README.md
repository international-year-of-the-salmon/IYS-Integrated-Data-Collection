## Hi there 👋

🙋 Welcome to the repository for the Integrated Data Collection. The dataset in the root of this folder called 'IYS_Integrated_Data_Collection' is a collection of all the International Year of the Salmon High Seas Expedition data integrated so far.

See the Changelog.txt file to get updates on what's changed between dataset versions.

🤖 See the metadata record for this dataset here: https://doi.org/10.21966/81jn-6p63

🐟 The repository is structured as follows: 
  * `input_datasets` contains processed data files (not standardized) that have been sent to the IYS Data Scientists.
  * `output_datasets` contains the individual integrated datasets specific to a data type (i.e. bridgelog, trawl, specimen, CTD). 
  
  These datasets are aggregated and integrated within the IYS_Integrated_Data_Collection_MASTER workbook. 
  
  * `archived_versions` contains older versions of the IYS_Integrated_Data_Collection_MASTER.xlsx file. Any changes between versions are recorded in the Changelog. 
  * `scripts` contains the code used to format and integrate the input datasets into the individual output datasets and the master file.
